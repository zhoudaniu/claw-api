title: Remove local Host API server and renderer Gateway transports
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Collapse backend communication to typed Electron IPC in the renderer, with OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket ownership kept in Electron Main.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Settings, channels, agents, providers, skills, cron, chat, sessions, files, media, usage, and diagnostics continue to work through typed hostApi calls.
  - Renderer no longer starts or contacts a local Host API HTTP server.
  - Renderer no longer opens a direct WebSocket or HTTP proxy transport to OpenClaw Gateway.
  - Gateway RPC and Gateway events continue through the Main-owned Gateway manager connection.
  - Gateway WebSocket frame diagnostics are available from Main-process logs when clawx_GATEWAY_WS_TRACE=1 is set.

acceptance:
  - No production source references the legacy Host API fetch/token IPC names, Gateway HTTP proxy channel, local Host API server startup, Host event bus, or renderer Gateway WS diagnostic toggles.
  - src/lib/api-client.ts is IPC-only and does not construct WebSocket or HTTP Gateway transports.
  - src/lib/host-api.ts exposes typed hostApi facade methods and does not export a path-based fetch helper.
  - src/lib/host-events.ts subscribes through typed IPC events and does not fall back to SSE/EventSource.
  - electron/api and local Host API route tests are removed.
  - README.md, README.zh-CN.md, and README.ja-JP.md describe typed IPC and Main-owned Gateway WebSocket ownership.
