title: Fix chat history timeout through gateway backend communication
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Reduce startup chat.history contention so foreground history loads do not time out behind sidebar background hydration.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Foreground chat history loading is prioritized during gateway startup and restart.
  - Sidebar/session label hydration does not compete with the first visible history load.
  - Sidebar label hydration uses the existing host API boundary instead of heavy gateway chat.history fan-out.
  - Renderer continues to use the existing host/store boundary.

  - tests/unit/host-services.test.ts
acceptance:
  - Renderer does not add direct IPC calls.
  - Renderer does not fetch Gateway HTTP directly.
  - Startup/restart no longer fans out sidebar label chat.history calls before the visible session history finishes loading.
  - Sidebar label hydration no longer depends on gateway chat.history full-session scans.
  - Foreground history uses a bounded startup RPC wait and falls back to local transcript reads instead of surfacing transient RPC timeout errors.
  - Foreground startup history can show local transcript data while chat.history is pending, then replace it with Gateway history without disabling startup retry.
  - Main-process chat.history RPCs are single-flighted/backpressured before reaching the Gateway.
