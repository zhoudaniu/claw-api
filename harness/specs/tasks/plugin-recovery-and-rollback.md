  - harness/specs/rules/active-config-guards.md
  - harness/specs/scenarios/plugin-lifecycle-management.md
expectedUserBehavior:
  - Failed plugin upgrades do not leave duplicate or stale active capability owners.
  - Removed or unconfigured capabilities have residual plugin registrations cleaned up.
  - Recovery preserves user-owned config where possible and leaves clear diagnostics when manual action is needed.
requiredProfiles:
  - fast
requiredTests:
  - tests/unit/openclaw-auth.test.ts
  - tests/unit/channel-config.test.ts
acceptance:
  - Recovery paths converge to a single diagnosable runtime state.
  - Stale plugin directories, entries, allowlist values, and install metadata are handled according to source type.
  - Rollback or cleanup behavior has direct regression coverage for the affected plugin class.
