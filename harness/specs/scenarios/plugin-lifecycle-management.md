Plugin lifecycle management covers bundled and external plugins as one system with different source types. The core model has two layers:

- `PluginPackage`: a discoverable, installable, upgradable, and recoverable package with identity, version, source, manifest, install location, and validation state.
- `PluginCapability`: an integration surface declared by a package, such as a channel, provider, skill, or runtime extension.

Lifecycle stages:

- Declare: plugin manifests describe package identity, source expectations, compatibility, and provided capabilities.
- Discover: clawx scans bundled and external sources and produces a factual inventory. Discovery does not choose active owners.
- Resolve: clawx chooses canonical package/capability owners, applies migration rules, and marks conflicts before config activation.
- Materialize: clawx installs, upgrades, copies, links, or verifies the physical package selected by resolution.
- Validate: clawx verifies package manifests, dependencies, capability config, ownership uniqueness, and startup requirements.
- Activate: only resolved and validated capabilities enter final OpenClaw runtime config.
- Recover: failed upgrades, stale registrations, conflicts, and removed channels converge to a single diagnosable state with rollback or cleanup paths.
- Package: cleanup and pruning keep packaged artifacts small without deleting target runtime assets; macOS universal packages keep both x64 and arm64 native payloads.

First-stage priority is integration safety: single-owner capability resolution, active config guards, direct regression tests for migration cases, and explicit task specs for resolution, validation, and recovery work.
