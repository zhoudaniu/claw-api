When clawx rewrites an explicit `models.providers.*` entry, existing model rows
must be merged by exact model ID instead of reconstructed from only `id` and
`name`.

All fields on an existing matching row are user/runtime-owned metadata and must
survive provider save, update, default-switch, and reload flows unless a task
explicitly owns that field.

New model IDs may receive deterministic capability defaults, but metadata from a
different model ID must never be copied onto them.
