## clawx Tool Notes

### uv (Python)

- `uv` is bundled with clawx and on PATH. Do NOT use bare `python` or `pip`.
- Run scripts: `uv run python <script>` | Install packages: `uv pip install <package>`

### Browser

- `browser` tool provides full automation (scraping, form filling, testing) via an isolated managed browser.
- Flow: `action="start"` → `action="snapshot"` (see page + get element refs like `e12`) → `action="act"` (click/type using refs).
- Open new tabs: `action="open"` with `targetUrl`.
- To just open a URL for the user to view, use `shell:openExternal` instead.
- If a browser action fails, transient errors (timeout, network) can often be resolved by retrying once or navigating to a different URL.
- When asked to search, look up, or interact with a web page, use the browser tool. Do not substitute with guesses or training data when real-time web access is requested.
